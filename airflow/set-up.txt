✅ 1. Start All Services Fresh
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml down


✅ 2. Check Health of All Containers
docker ps


✅ 3. Check Airflow Services Are Healthy (Web + Scheduler)
docker logs airflow-airflow-webserver-1 --tail 30
docker logs airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 --tail 30


✅ 4. (Optional) Test Scheduler Is Working [DAG List]
docker exec -it airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 airflow dags list


✅ 5. (Optional) Trigger a Test DAG Manually
docker exec -it airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 airflow dags trigger <dag_id>
docker exec -it airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 airflow dags trigger cfpb_daily_fetch_automatic


✅ 6. (Optional) Check Number of Trigger Runs
docker exec -it airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 airflow dags list-runs -d <dag_id>
docker exec -it airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 airflow dags list-runs -d cfpb_daily_fetch
docker exec -it airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 airflow dags list-runs -d first_dag_for_seq_tasks


✅7. Check the next scheduled run: [Deprecated Command]
docker exec -it airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 airflow dags next-execution -d cfpb_daily_fetch_auto_tr



## To clean & rebuild
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml down --volumes --remove-orphans


## If first time or you removed volumes — reinitialize the Airflow DB
docker compose run airflow-webserver airflow db init


## Create Airflow Admin User for You
docker compose run airflow-webserver airflow users create \
  --username bapan \
  --password bapan@123 \
  --firstname Bapan \
  --lastname Bairagya \
  --role Admin \

## Airflow DAG Not Running? Quick Rescue Playbook ##

Problem Summary

 1. DAG was stuck in 'queued' and never moved to 'running'.
   - Root Cause: Airflow Scheduler was broken due to a port conflict: ('::', 8793).
 2. Manual DAG triggers also stayed in 'queued'.
   - Root Cause: Scheduler was not processing tasks properly due to Gunicorn port conflict.


 Steps to Fix
 1. Restart the scheduler container to free up the port and reset the process:
   $ docker restart airflow-airflow-scheduler-1

 2. Verify DAG is registered:
   $ docker exec -it airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 airflow dags list

 3. Manually trigger the DAG:
   $ docker exec -it airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 airflow dags trigger <dag_id>

 4. View scheduler logs to confirm it's alive and processing:
   $ docker logs airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 --tail 100

 Bonus Tips
  - DAGs are scheduled to run after their interval passes. Use '*/5 * * * *' for testing.
  - If you're stuck inside a container, type 'exit' to leave.
  - Use Airflow UI > Graph or Gantt view > Task Logs to debug individual runs.
  - Clean up config deprecation warning by moving 'sql_alchemy_conn' under [database] in airflow.cfg or .env.


 Takeaway
 If a DAG is stuck in 'queued', the Airflow Scheduler is likely unhealthy. Restarting it usually resolves the
 issue
